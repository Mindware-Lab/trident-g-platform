Zone Coach Standalone (Pricing + Positioning)

## What is Zone Coach?
Zone Coach is a **3–6 minute daily cognitive readiness check** you run before training or deep work.

It’s similar in spirit to athletes using HR/HRV for training decisions, but designed for **cognitive performance**:

- A fast **behavioural probe** (dot probe with lures) to sample steadiness and impulse control
- A simple **state label** (in-band / too hot / too cold / shaky)
- A short **reset protocol** (breathing) with a quick re-check
- Optional **sensor biometrics** for long-run trends:
  - Polar H10 (or similar strap): **RR intervals → DFA α1 baseline trend** + HR during probe
  - Optional EEG (e.g., BrainBit): **EEG criticality-style features** during the same baseline window

Zone Coach is a **training-readiness and self-regulation** tool. It is not a medical device.

## Who is it for?
- Knowledge workers who want a reliable “am I trainable right now?” check
- Students and high performers who want to reduce “bad state training”
- Creators/executives who want more consistent deep work sessions
- People focused on **cognitive longevity** who want a simple daily way to track readiness and build better training consistency over time
- Anyone who already owns (or is willing to buy) a chest strap and wants an app that makes the data *actionable*

---

## What makes it different (vs generic HRV apps)
Most HRV apps give a single readiness score based on physiology only.

Zone Coach adds:
- **Cognitive probe metrics** (performance, drift, impulse capture)
- **State-gated intervention** (you can run the reset immediately)
- **Trend signals that are linked to performance**, not just physiology
- Optional long-run **mind–body coupling** tracking (physiology + EEG + behaviour)

---

## What users get (core loop)
1) **Daily Prime** (η/χ/λ): Confidence, Consistency, Support  
2) Optional **baseline DFA α1** (2 minutes, normal breathing) — trend only  
3) **Dot probe with lures** (Go/No-Go) + optional HR during the probe  
4) **Quick self-ratings** (focus/drive/tension etc.)  
5) A single recommended reset: **Upshift / Stabilise / Downshift**  
6) **Re-check** dot probe + “more/neutral/less in-zone”  
7) A clear recommendation: **Proceed / Light session / Stop & reset**

---

## Hardware (BYO)
Zone Coach is designed to work **without sensors**, but supports sensors for better trend tracking.

- Chest strap recommended: **Polar H10** (RR intervals for DFA α1)
- Optional EEG: e.g., **BrainBit** headband (for EEG trend features)

Users purchase hardware separately.

## Pricing Bands
A simple model with no subscription.

### Zone Coach Basic  
Includes:
- Daily Prime (η/χ/λ)
- Dot probe with lures (pre/post breathing)
- Self-ratings + state label
- Reset protocol (Upshift/Stabilise/Downshift)
- Training recommendation (proceed/light/stop)
- Local-first history and simple trend charts

### Zone Coach Pro  
Everything in Basic, plus:
- Sensor pairing (BLE) for compatible chest straps
- Baseline DFA α1 trend (RR intervals) — recorded once per day
- Heart rate captured during dot probe windows (pre/post)
- “Mind–Body Trend” dashboard (behaviour + physiology over time)
- Correlation view over time (e.g., DFA α1 ↔ dot probe stability)

### Optional: EEG Expansion Pack  
Adds:
- EEG device integration (where supported by platform/SDK)
- EEG trend features (e.g., LRTC-style / stability features you select)
- Combined **Mind–Body Criticality Index** (trend only)
- Correlation view: EEG ↔ DFA α1 ↔ dot probe stability over time

> Note: EEG features are exploratory biometrics for performance training, not clinical metrics.

---

## What you can safely claim (and what you shouldn’t)
### Safe positioning
- “Daily cognitive readiness check”
- “State drift reduction”
- “More consistent training sessions”
- “Trend tracking of mind/body signals alongside performance”

### Avoid
- “Diagnoses”
- “Treats insomnia/burnout/pain”
- “Medical-grade brain criticality”
- “Guaranteed IQ increases”

---

## Why it should sell  
People already pay for:
- Straps and wearables
- HRV apps
- Focus and productivity tools

Zone Coach is the missing layer that:
- checks readiness with a **behavioural probe**
- gives a **clear intervention**
- builds a **personal trend profile** over time

It’s “HRV for cognition”, with a built-in reset.

## Privacy-first by default
- No account required
- Local browser storage by default (local-first)
- Optional export for users who want to analyse their data elsewhere
