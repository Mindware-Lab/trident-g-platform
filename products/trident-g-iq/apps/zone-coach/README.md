# Ψ Zone Coach (Trident-G) 

Ψ Zone Coach is a quick **cognitive readiness check** you can run **once per day**:

1) **As a standalone test** to gauge whether you’re in a **near-critical, highly trainable “Ψ Zone”** for general, wide-ranging cognitive work (deep work, study, creative problem solving, decision-making), and/or  
2) **As a pre-training state gate** before any Trident-G training session.

Its job is simple:

- Help you start in a **trainable mental state** (the “Ψ/G Zone”), instead of guessing.
- Reduce **state drift** (overload, scatteredness, low drive, shaky control) before you train or do demanding cognitive work.
- Protect learning quality by recommending either a normal session, a lighter stabilising session, or a **recovery day** when training would be low quality.

Trident-G compounds by **training consistently in the right state**, not by grinding harder.

## What you’ll do (the full flow)

### 0) Optional: Pair a Polar H10 (or similar chest strap) for RR + heart rate
If you have a **Polar H10**, you can pair it once per session to record:

- **RR intervals** (for the baseline DFA α1 trend)
- **Heart rate** during the dot probes (before and after breathing)

If you’re already wearing the strap, this is usually quick: tap **Pair sensor** and select your strap.

- You’ll be asked for permission by the browser
- Works best in **Chrome/Edge** (desktop or Android). Safari does not support this pairing method.

**Good news:** Ψ Zone Coach uses the **standard Bluetooth Heart Rate service**, so the same pairing method and code usually works with other devices that expose **Heart Rate Measurement + RR intervals** (many chest straps do).  
If a device does not broadcast RR intervals, Ψ Zone Coach will still run normally (you’ll just skip DFA α1 baseline trending).

You can also skip pairing and run Ψ Zone Coach using only the dot probe + self-ratings.

---

### 1) Daily Prime (≈20–30 seconds)
Three quick ratings that shape today’s session:

- **Confidence (η):** “How capable do I feel today?”
- **Consistency (χ):** “How coherent/settled do I feel?”
- **Support (λ):** “How supportive is my environment right now?”

These aren’t diagnoses. They’re a short daily “set” that helps you start cleanly and consistently.

---

### 2) Baseline complexity (DFA α1) — trend only (≈2 minutes, optional)
If RR intervals are available, Ψ Zone Coach can take a calm baseline reading of **DFA α1** (a heart-rhythm complexity/correlation metric).

- Normal breathing (not paced)
- Same posture each day if possible
- No “pass/fail” here: this is tracked as a **long-run trend** across days/weeks

> Important: this baseline is **not** used as the immediate “in the zone today” verdict.

If no sensor is paired (or RR isn’t available), Ψ Zone Coach skips this step and continues.

---

### 3) Dot probe (≈60–90 seconds) + heart rate (optional)
A short reaction-time check to sample steadiness and impulse control.

- Press **only** when the **GO dot** appears (e.g., white)
- **Do not press** for the **NO-GO dot** (e.g., lime)
- Don’t “pre-tap” while waiting

If a strap is paired, Ψ Zone Coach also records **average heart rate during the dot probe** as a supporting arousal signal.

---

### 4) Quick self-ratings (0–10)
A fast snapshot of trainability **right now** (reduced set):

- **Energy (E):** usable energy to start and keep going
- **Tension (S):** how tense/on edge you feel
- **Mental chatter (N):** how noisy your mind feels
- **Plan switching / second-guessing (C):** changing direction, indecision
- **Stuckness / rigidity (R):** flexibility vs getting locked into one way

Keep it quick and honest.

---

### 5) You get a state label + readout quality
Ψ Zone Coach shows:

- Your **state label** (your current readiness “mode”)
- A simple **read quality** signal (how trustworthy today’s reading is)
- A simple **certainty** signal (how confidently the app is classifying your state)

These are there to prevent over-interpreting noisy readings.

---

### 6) Breathing reset (3 minutes)
Ψ Zone Coach offers **three mindful breathing options** (3 minutes each).  
The app selects one automatically based on your current mode, but you can treat them as simple tools:

- **Upshift:** inhale-led, gentle activation (2–4s inhale, 2–3s exhale)  
- **Stabilise (4–6):** slow stabilising rhythm (4s inhale, 6s exhale)  
- **Downshift:** cyclic sighing (two 1s inhales, 7s exhale)

If you feel dizzy or unwell at any point, stop and return to normal breathing.

---

### 7) Recheck (≈30–60 seconds) + quick self-check
After breathing:

- A short **recheck dot probe**
- One simple question: **Do you feel more / neutral / less in the zone than before?**

If a strap is paired, Ψ Zone Coach also records **average heart rate** during the recheck dot probe.

Ψ Zone Coach then computes a simple “today improved?” readout based primarily on:
- dot probe change (fewer false alarms, steadier responses)
- your subjective shift (more/neutral/less)

Heart rate is treated as secondary corroboration only.

---

### 8) Your recommendation (what to do next)
Ψ Zone Coach ends with one clear output:

- **Proceed** (normal training or demanding cognitive work), or
- **Light session recommended** (shorter, stabilising, lower intensity), or
- **Recovery day** (rest day) if you look strongly dysregulated and do not re-enter after a reset attempt, or
- **Re-run later** if read quality was poor (don’t over-interpret today)

If you choose **Proceed** or **Light**, a button sends you to the **Capacity Training Coach** (n-back).

---

## What the labels mean (plain English)

### In the Ψ/G Zone (in-band)
Alert enough, steady enough, not overloaded. Best for normal training and deeper work.

### Too cold (underpowered)
Low activation/drive. You can still do useful work, but keep it gentle. Goal is engagement and consistency.

### Too hot (overloaded)
High strain or scatteredness. Training quality often drops unless you downshift first.

### Shaky (unstable)
Fluctuating control and inconsistent responding. The goal is stabilisation and clean reps.

---

## What “Recovery day” means (and what to do)
A recovery day is not failure. It is **training hygiene**.

If Ψ Zone Coach recommends **Recovery day**, aim for 2–3 simple behaviours:

- **Skip capacity training** today (protect learning quality)
- **10–30 minutes easy movement** (walk, mobility)
- **Hydrate and eat properly**
- **Protect sleep** (earlier night if you can)
- If you must work: choose **low-stakes admin**, avoid high-stakes decisions

---

## How to useΨ Ψ Zone Coach (the compounding method)

Run it **once per day** before training, or before a demanding work block.

Make it clean:
- Phone on silent
- Close extra tabs
- Sit comfortably
- Take it seriously, but keep it light

Follow the recommendation.
A “light” day or “recovery” day is often what keeps the whole system progressing over weeks.

---

## What Ψ Zone Coach stores (privacy)
Ψ Zone Coach stores your recent check results **locally in your own browser** (via `localStorage`) so the next app can read the handoff.

- No account needed
- No cloud upload by default
- Your browser holds recent history (rolling window)

If you clear browser storage, your local history resets.

---

## Safety notes
- This tool is for **training readiness**, not medical assessment.
- If you feel dizzy, panicky, or unwell during breathing, **stop** and breathe normally.
- If you have medical concerns (especially respiratory/cardiovascular), use common sense and seek appropriate professional advice.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Bluetooth pairing doesn’t appear**
- Use **Chrome or Edge**
- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device
- Wear the strap (it must be awake) and disconnect it from other apps
- Your site must be on **https** (or `localhost`) for pairing

**Read quality seems inconsistent**
- Sit still for the baseline (if using it)
- Don’t pre-tap during the dot probe
- Avoid interruptions (don’t tab away)
- Try to measure at a similar time each day

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

---

## What this app is really doing (one sentence)
Ψ Zone Coach helps you **enter and maintain a near-critical trainable corridor** for wide-ranging cognitive performance and Trident-G training, while (optionally) tracking baseline mind–body dynamics as a long-run trend using RR/heart rate (and, in future, EEG).
