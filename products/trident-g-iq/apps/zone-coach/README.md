# Zone Coach (Trident-G) — Quick State Check → Reset → Start Training

Zone Coach is a 3–6 minute “state gate” you run **before** any Trident-G training session.

Its job is simple:

- **Help you start in a trainable mental state** (“the G Zone”), instead of guessing.
- **Reduce state drift** (overload, scatteredness, low drive, rigidity) before you train.
- **Protect learning quality** by recommending either a normal session or a lighter stabilising session.

This is how Trident-G compounds: not by grinding harder, but by **training consistently in the right state**.

---

## What you’ll do (the full flow)

### 1) Fast dot probe (≈30 taps)
A short reaction-time check to sample steadiness and lapses.

- Tap as fast as you can **only when the dot appears**
- Don’t “pre-tap” while waiting

This helps Zone Coach avoid being purely mood-led.

### 2) Quick self-ratings (0–10)
You’ll rate a few practical things like:

- **Energy**
- **Tension**
- **Focus steadiness**
- **Mental chatter**
- **Mental load**
- **Plan switching**
- **Stuckness**

These are not “diagnoses”. They’re just a quick snapshot of how trainable your mind feels **right now**.

### 3) You get a state label + a recommended reset (3 minutes)
Zone Coach will show your current state, plus one of three short breathing resets:

- **Upshift** (if you’re underpowered)
- **Amplify** (if you’re already close to the G Zone and want to stabilise)
- **Downshift** (if you’re overloaded / scattered / too hot)

If you feel dizzy or unwell at any point, stop and return to normal breathing.

### 4) Recheck dot probe + “How do you feel now?”
After breathing, you’ll do a short recheck and a simple “how do you feel now?” selection.

### 5) Your recommendation
Zone Coach ends with one of two outcomes:

- **Proceed with training** (normal session)
- **Light session recommended** (short, stabilising, lower intensity)

A button then sends you to the **Capacity Training Coach**.

## What the labels mean (plain English)

### **In the G Zone**
You’re in a good place to learn: alert enough, steady enough, and not overloaded.

### **Underpowered**
Low drive/activation. You can still train, but gently. The goal is engagement, not heroics.

### **Overloaded**
High strain, scattered attention, or rigid “stuck” control. Training quality usually drops here unless you stabilise first.

### Confidence + signal quality (reliability)
Zone Coach also shows a **confidence** and **signal quality** readout to tell you how reliable today’s check is.

Signal quality may drop if:
- you had interruptions (tab switching / leaving the window),
- there were lots of early taps or lapses,
- responses were very inconsistent.

When signal quality is **Poor**, Zone Coach automatically becomes more conservative and tends to recommend a **light** session.

## Best way to use Zone Coach (the “compounding” method)

**Do this once per day before training.** The goal is consistency, not perfect results.

**Make it clean:**
- Put your phone on silent
- Close extra tabs
- Sit comfortably
- Take it seriously, but keep it light

**Follow the recommendation.**
If you’re told “light session”, that’s not failure. That’s **smart training hygiene**.

Trident-G works when you:
- avoid grinding in bad states,
- keep sessions short and repeatable,
- let stability + good reps accumulate.

## What Zone Coach stores (privacy)

Zone Coach stores your recent check results **locally in your own browser** (via localStorage) so the next app can read the handoff.

- No account needed
- No cloud upload by default
- Your browser holds the recent history (a rolling window)

If you clear your browser storage, your local history resets.

---

## Safety notes

- This tool is for **training readiness**, not medical assessment.
- If you feel dizzy, panicky, or unwell during the breathing reset, **stop** and breathe normally.
- If you have any medical concerns (especially respiratory or cardiovascular), use common sense and seek appropriate professional advice.

---

## Troubleshooting

**“Ping” sounds don’t play**
- Some browsers block audio until you interact.
- Start the reset, click once, and it usually unlocks.

**Signal quality keeps showing “Poor”**
- Reduce interruptions (don’t tab away)
- Don’t pre-tap while waiting for the dot
- Do the check when you can be still and focused for ~3 minutes

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

## What this app is *really* doing (in one sentence)

Zone Coach helps you **enter and maintain the trainable corridor** where Trident-G training produces portable gains, instead of wasting sessions in overload, rigidity, or low drive.
