# IQ Mindware Coach (Trident-G)

IQ Mindware Coach is a **short, structured mindware training app** that helps you practise practical thinking tools with **timed, right/wrong feedback**, then apply them to a **real-life mission** so they become habits you can reuse.

It is designed to work:
- **Standalone** (mindware practice + missions),
- **Alongside Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended as a separate first step), and
- **As part of the full Trident-G stack** (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission).

> **Important note:** evidence for “far transfer” from cognitive training in general is mixed. This app is designed to *increase the probability* of real-world carryover by combining **guided testing**, **portability checks across contexts**, and **implementation intentions** (cue-based plans), rather than relying on insight or motivation alone.

---

## What this app trains

You practise **portable thinking routines** (“Mindware Scripts”) across many different scenarios, so you can:
- spot the **best next step** (not the tempting one),
- choose actions under **trade-offs** and **uncertainty**,
- tighten claims and avoid reasoning traps,
- simplify complexity under constraints,
- and convert the learning into a **repeatable mission habit**.

---

## How skills become automatic (Trident-G: effort → habit)

In Trident-G, you do not just “learn an idea”. You **build a skill that becomes easy to use**.

This happens in three stages:

1) **Effort mode (Gf)**  
   You run a script deliberately, step by step. It takes attention.

2) **Compilation (Gc)**  
   If it works, you **compress it into a Mindware Script** you can recall quickly:  
   **Trigger → Steps → Quick check → Common trap (+ stop/flip rule)**

3) **Reuse under pressure (back to Gf when needed)**  
   You then use the same script in different situations. Over time it becomes fast and reliable, even when you are busy or stressed.

**Key point:** making a tool “automatic” takes strategic effort.  
This app supports that by combining **timed practice**, **real missions**, and **saving/reusing Mindware Scripts**.

---

## The four mission types (how scenarios are organised)

Scenarios and missions come in four categories (these are also the four *lenses* used for portability checks):

1) **Understand** (Beliefs / Comprehension)  
2) **Discuss** (Argument / Conflict handling)  
3) **Choose** (Decision making)  
4) **Plan & Do** (Planning / Strategic action)

These categories are how the app checks whether a script **travels** across different kinds of problem.

---

## The Mindware Script Library (Level 1.5)

In Trident-G, **far transfer** is supported when learning is tethered to a portable target **Y** (“what must generalise”), not surface cues.  
In this design, the **Y-library is the Mindware Script library**.

There are **11 scripts total**:
- **1 meta script:** **Y0**
- **10 mindware scripts:** **Y1–Y10**

Each script is both:
- a **portable invariant** (what must generalise), and
- a **user-facing routine** (what you do repeatedly),

with **Gate + Check enforced in every script**.

---

### Y0 — Engage + satisficing gate (commitment + stopping discipline) **[META]**

**Use when:** you are unsure whether the problem is worth attention, or you tend to overthink/loop.  
**Recognition question:** *“Is this worth committing to now, and what is ‘good enough’ so I can move on?”*  
**Near-miss:** *“I’ll think a bit more”* with no timebox, no threshold, no park/commit decision.  
**Primitives recruited:** Gate → Mode → Gist (often followed by Route into a specific Y).  
**Explore:** set stakes × reversibility × uncertainty; pick rigour preset; set timebox.  
**Exploit:** commit or park; define satisficing threshold + stop rule; route into the next Y.  
**Gc gist:** *“Commit or park. Set rigour + timebox. Define ‘good enough’. Then run one chosen script.”*

---

### Y1 — The One Test (Discriminating test first: Crux + value of information)

**Use when:** one uncertainty or assumption is driving the whole choice.  
**Recognition question:** *“What single test would most change what I do next?”*  
**Near-miss:** *“Research more”* without a concrete probe or measurement.  
**Primitives recruited:** Gate → Options → Check → Route (Mode enforces explore→exploit).  
**Explore:** generate 2–3 rival hypotheses + 2–3 candidate discriminators.  
**Exploit:** pick the smallest discriminating test + define the flip rule.  
**Gc gist:** *“When stuck, force a crux test: smallest probe that flips the plan.”*

---

### Y2 — Trade-Off Choice (Decision under trade-offs + uncertainty)

**Use when:** options compete across goals, criteria, and uncertainty.  
**Recognition question:** *“What am I optimising, and what uncertainty could flip the best option?”*  
**Near-miss:** choosing by vibe, or building a matrix with no sensitivity/flip test.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Gate → Check → Gist (often calls Y1 to choose the next probe).  
**Explore:** widen options/criteria; identify the one uncertain estimate that matters.  
**Exploit:** choose + run a sensitivity flip + select one info probe.  
**Gc gist:** *“Choose by structured trade-offs + flip test, not by narrative.”*

---

### Y3 — Expected Value Choice (Value × probability, then compare)

**Use when:** outcomes are uncertain and you can roughly quantify value and probability.  
**Recognition question:** *“Which probability or value estimate drives the decision, and what would change it?”*  
**Near-miss:** EV theatre (made-up precision), or skipping the one estimate that matters.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Gate → Check → Options → Gist (often invokes Y1 for the probe).  
**Explore:** sketch outcomes; rough values and probabilities; identify decision-relevant uncertainty.  
**Exploit:** compare EVs; time-box one probe to tighten the key estimate; re-run.  
**Gc gist:** *“Compute rough EV, then buy information only where it can flip the choice.”*

---

### Y4 — Claim → Support (Claim → evidence → warrant)

**Use when:** evaluating or constructing an argument (what supports what, and why).  
**Recognition question:** *“What is the warrant that connects this evidence to this claim?”*  
**Near-miss:** listing evidence without a warrant, or shifting definitions mid-stream.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Bind → Check → Gist  
**Explore:** build both sides’ maps; identify hidden assumptions.  
**Exploit:** test whether evidence type matches the warrant; tighten claim scope.  
**Gc gist:** *“No warrant = no support. Bind terms, then test the link.”*

---

### Y5 — Cause Chain (Mechanism-first causal model: driver → mediator → outcome)

**Use when:** acting on a system and you need a causal chain, not a label.  
**Recognition question:** *“Driver → mediator → outcome: what causal story am I betting on?”*  
**Near-miss:** treating correlation, vibes, or category labels as mechanism.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Bind → Options → Check  
**Explore:** propose rival mechanisms; generate distinct causal routes.  
**Exploit:** derive a falsifiable prediction + one discriminating probe (often Y1).  
**Gc gist:** *“Name the causal chain → predict → probe → update.”*

---

### Y6 — Bottleneck First (Constraint / bottleneck first)

**Use when:** progress is limited by one constraint, so optimising elsewhere is wasted motion.  
**Recognition question:** *“What is the limiting constraint that, if moved, makes everything else easier?”*  
**Near-miss:** polishing non-bottlenecks (busywork), or confusing symptoms with constraints.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Gate → Route → Check  
**Explore:** identify candidate bottlenecks and alternative constraints.  
**Exploit:** choose one constraint-relief move + confirm the bottleneck shifted.  
**Gc gist:** *“Find the bottleneck → act on it → verify it shifted.”*

---

### Y7 — Make It Measurable (Measurement / operational definition discipline)

**Use when:** goals are fuzzy, success criteria are vague, or you cannot tell if anything improved.  
**Recognition question:** *“What would I actually observe or measure if this were true?”*  
**Near-miss:** abstract constructs with no variables, no success signal, or no feasible measurement step.  
**Where it lives:** problem.successSignal, problem.minAcceptableWin, and “action must be a measurable probe” checks.  
**Primitives recruited:** Map → Bind → Check → Gate  
**Explore:** define observable signals and feasible measures.  
**Exploit:** select the smallest measurable probe and a stopping rule.  
**Gc gist:** *“No measure, no loop. Operationalise before optimising.”*

---

### Y8 — Simplify Under Constraints (Minimum viable model under constraints)

**Use when:** you’re over-thinking, the situation is messy, time/energy is limited, or you keep building maps that never cash out into action.  
**Recognition question:** *“What is the smallest model that still lets me run a discriminating test or take one useful step?”*  
**Near-miss (tempting wrong move):**
- “Keep it simple” with no variables, no test, no metric  
- Dropping the key constraint or flip uncertainty  
- Building a big map as avoidance  
**Primitives recruited:** Gate → Map → Gist → Check (often followed by Route).  
**Explore (bounded):** list 5–8 candidate variables/constraints, then identify the likely driver/bottleneck, the hard constraint, and the flip uncertainty.  
**Exploit:** prune to a 3–5 node minimum viable map, then choose one smallest discriminating test or executable step.  
**Gc gist:** *“Prune to the smallest map that still predicts. Keep the constraint + flip uncertainty. Run one test.”*

---

### Y9 — Strategic Experiment (Intervene to learn which policy works)

**Use when:** you need to learn causally by acting, and you can run a time-bounded intervention (A/B, before–after, ABAB).  
**Recognition question:** *“Which strategy should I run, for how long, and what would count as ‘works’?”*  
**Near-miss:** endless planning, passive observation, or changing many things at once.  
**Primitives recruited:** Gate → Map → Bind → Route → Check → Gist (Mode enforces bounded exploration then execution).  
**Explore:** define hypothesis, intervention, comparator, primary metric, horizon, decision rule.  
**Exploit:** run for the horizon; apply the decision rule; update belief and next policy.  
**Gc gist:** *“Run a time-boxed intervention with a metric + decision rule. Keep or switch based on evidence.”*

---

### Y10 — Evidence Update (Belief revision after probes)

**Use when:** you have new evidence from a probe/experiment and need to update confidence and policy cleanly.  
**Recognition question:** *“Given this evidence, what should I believe now and what will I do differently?”*  
**Near-miss:** ignoring disconfirming evidence, or over-updating from weak evidence.  
**Primitives recruited:** Check → Gate → Gist (often calls Map/Bind if definitions drift).  
**Explore:** rate evidence strength/relevance; generate the strongest disconfirming interpretation.  
**Exploit:** update confidence one notch at a time; revise the policy; define the next probe only if worth it.  
**Gc gist:** *“Update confidence proportionally, then change the plan (or not) explicitly.”*

---

### Script enforcement rule (applies to all mindware scripts)

Disconfirmation and costed search are **not extra scripts**. They are expressions of **Gate + Check**, enforced as required fields (or a consistent footer) in every Y-script:

- **Disconfirm (Check):** *“If I’m wrong, I’d expect to see ___.”*  
- **Costed search (Gate):** *“Is it worth searching/probing more?”*  
- **Flip/stop rule (Check + Gist):** *“If ___, I switch.”* / *“Stop after ___.”*

---

## Level 2: The same scripts expressed through the 4 lenses (mission types)

Think of each lens as a domain where the same primitives become concrete, with different wrappers, different near-misses, and different success signals.

**Shared entry gate (all lenses):**  
**Y0 Engage + Satisfice** runs first: commit vs park, rigour preset, timebox + stop rule, and a “good enough” threshold.

---

### Lens A — Beliefs / Comprehension (**Understand**)

**Goal:** build and update a relational model of what is true.  
**Core scripts:** Y1, Y5, Y7, Y8, Y10  
**Strategic Experiment:** Y9 when you can intervene to test a mechanism prediction.  
**Common near-misses:**
- “I need more research” without naming a discriminating probe (Y1 + Gate)
- Treating labels as mechanisms (Y5 + Check)
- Vague constructs with no success signal (Y7)

---

### Lens B — Argument / Conflict handling (**Discuss**)

**Goal:** stress-test and resolve conflict between models without collapsing into vibes.  
**Core scripts:** Y4, Y1, Y2, Y10  
**Strategic Experiment:** Y9 for behavioural A/B in conflict resolution (track a concrete outcome).  
**Common near-misses:**
- Shifting definitions mid-stream (Bind failure)
- “Winning” rhetorically while ignoring what would change your mind (Check failure)
- Treating value conflicts as factual disputes (use Y2)

---

### Lens C — Decision making (**Choose**)

**Goal:** translate beliefs + values into choice under uncertainty.  
**Core scripts:** Y2, Y3, Y1, Y7, Y10  
**Strategic Experiment:** Y9 when decisions are best made by trial periods or staged commitments.  
**Common near-misses:**
- Matrix with no sensitivity/flip test (Check failure)
- Over-precision theatre (Bind/Gate failure)
- Avoiding decision by endless search (Gate failure; fix with Y0)

---

### Lens D — Planning / Strategic action (**Plan & Do**)

**Goal:** turn chosen goals into executable operator sequences that survive reality.  
**Core scripts:** Y6, Y8, Y7, Y1, Y9, Y10  
**Common near-misses:**
- “Planning” that never touches the world (Route + Check failure; fix with Y9)
- Optimising non-bottlenecks (needs Y6)
- No monitoring triggers or stop rules (needs Y0 + Gate + Gist)

---

## The consolidation lens: Gf → Gc → Gf (how a script becomes a reliable skill)

This is the “how it becomes real” layer: scripts start as explicit effort (**Gf**), then are compiled into cheap retrieval (**Gc**), then must be redeployed under novelty (**back to Gf**) to prove portability.

1) **Gf installation (in-loop, under uncertainty)**  
   Run the script explicitly. If a “click” happens, capture it immediately so it lands on **portable Y**, not wrapper cues.

2) **Gc compilation (Mindware Script)**  
   Save a retrieval unit with hard structure: **trigger → steps → check → trap/boundary + cue + stop/flip rule**.

3) **Gf redeploy under novelty (portability proof)**  
   Wrapper swaps + near-miss discrimination + mild load variation. Thin automation fails here by design.

4) **Reliability threshold (when you can claim “installed”)**  
   Use a two-tier rule:  
   - **Transfer observed:** at least one wrapper swap success + at least one cue-fired real-world deployment.  
   - **Reliable far transfer:** multiple wrapper families, multiple cue-fires across days, boundary discrimination, and stability under mild load variation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Suggested internal status ladder:
**Draft → Swap-Pass 1 → Swap-Pass 2 → Cue-Fire 1 → Cue-Fire 2 → Cue-Fire 3 → Boundary-Pass → Reliable (Gc)**

---

## Three ways to use this app

### 1) Standalone (simple)
Use Mindware Coach as your daily or weekly practice:
**Practice (timed) → Mission → Save script.**

### 2) After **Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended)
Run **Ψ Zone Coach first** (separately), then do Mindware training.

> This app does **not** do zone recalibration. All state regulation and recovery steps live in **Ψ Zone Coach**.

### 3) Full stack (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission)
If you use the integrated Trident-G protocol:

1. **Ψ Zone Coach**: check state and choose session intensity  
2. **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: short drill block (optional warm-up or main training)  
3. **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed scenarios + feedback + mission planning  
4. **Mission**: apply the script in real life (10–20 mins)

A future **G Loop app** can coordinate this full flow for users who want the complete protocol.

---

## What a session looks like

### Step 1 — Choose today’s mission type + script (30 seconds)
- Pick **Understand / Discuss / Choose / Plan & Do**
- Pick **one** script (the app can recommend one)

### Step 2 — Timed practice with feedback (3–8 minutes)
Short scenario set with:
- **multiple choice** questions,
- **time limits** (optional),
- **instant feedback** (right/wrong + a short explanation).

### Step 3 — Choose a real-life mission (10–20 minutes)
Specify something real you need to do today.

### Step 4 — Do the mission (10–20 minutes)
Apply the script in real life.

**Examples**
- **Understand:** read a brief and write a 5-sentence summary + 3 “check questions”.
- **Discuss:** draft a calm reply with one clear claim, two supports, one counterpoint, then revise once.
- **Choose:** run a Trade-Off or EV pass, then do one flip check (what would change your mind?).
- **Plan & Do:** write the next 3 steps and do step 1 immediately.

### Step 5 — Compile it into a Mindware Script (30–60 seconds)
If it helped, save:
**Trigger → Steps → Quick check → Common trap (+ stop/flip rule).**

### Step 6 — Reuse it later (portability checks)
The app brings the same script back in a different mission type, and prompts daily-life reuse.

---

## Portability checks (how this app tests “does it travel?”)

This app runs **portability swaps** by keeping the same script but changing the wrapper:

- **Understand ↔ Discuss ↔ Choose ↔ Plan & Do**

To the user it feels like variety.  
To the system it is a carryover check.

---

## The practice engine (how you get right/wrong feedback)

Each script has scenarios across all four mission types, so practice stays varied and measurable.

Typical question formats:
- **Single best answer** (A–D)
- **Spot the trap** (tempting wrong option)
- **Order the steps** (sequencing)
- **Pick the best check/metric** (what would test it?)
- **Minimum viable simplification** (smallest useful model)

Each item includes:
- the correct answer,
- a one-line “why this is right”,
- and a short reason the main traps fail.

---

## Missions (real-world deployment)

A mission is a small, repeatable, measurable task you genuinely need to do.  
It is not extra homework. It is the “carryover step”.

Examples:
- **Understand**: 5-sentence summary + 3 questions you can answer without re-reading
- **Discuss**: narrower claim + strongest support + one counterpoint
- **Choose**: quick trade-off grid + flip check
- **Plan & Do**: next 3 steps + do step 1 immediately

---

## Mindware Scripts (what you build over time)

Each saved script includes:
- **Trigger** (When should I use this?)
- **Steps** (3–5 bullets)
- **Quick check** (How do I know it worked?)
- **Trap / near-miss** (Tempting wrong move)
- **Stop/flip rule** (When I stop or switch)

Simple progress labels:
- **Practised** (I can do it with effort)
- **Compiled** (I have a clear script I can follow)
- **Used in real life** (it worked on a mission)
- **Works in different situations** (it travels)
- **Reliable habit** (fast and dependable)

---

## Optional warm-up (if you also use Capacity Coach)

If you use **IQ Capacity Training Coach**, a short warm-up can make mindware practice easier under time pressure:

- Feeling distracted or mentally noisy → **standard n-back**
- Need to understand cause/effect links → **transitive**
- Need to plan steps or choose a route → **graph**
- Need to argue clearly or test a claim → **propositional**

Warm-ups are optional. The core learning here is:
**timed practice → feedback → mission → repeat.**

---

## What this app stores (privacy)

IQ Mindware Coach stores your progress **locally in your own browser** (via `localStorage`) so it can work without accounts.

Stored items include:
- practice scores (right/wrong, time taken),
- chosen scripts and mission types,
- saved Mindware Scripts,
- mission plans (implementation intentions),
- basic streak/usage history.

*No cloud upload by default.*  
If you clear your browser storage, your local history resets.

---

## Troubleshooting

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

---

## Where this fits in the wider Trident-G stack

- **Ψ Zone Coach**: state check + recovery steps (separate app)
- **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: n-back drills (control + relational structure learning)
- **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed mindware training + missions (this app). This is where Trident-G’s **effort → compile → reuse** loop is built, using Mindware Scripts as the “compiled” form.
- **G Loop app (future)**: optional hub coordinating the full protocol across apps
