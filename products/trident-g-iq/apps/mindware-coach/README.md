# IQ Mindware Coach (Trident-G)

IQ Mindware Coach is a **short, structured mindware training app** that helps you practise practical thinking tools with **timed, right/wrong feedback**, then apply them to a **real-life mission** so they become habits you can reuse.

It is designed to work:
- **Standalone** (mindware practice + missions),
- **Alongside Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended as a separate first step), and
- **As part of the full Trident-G stack** (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission).

> **Important note:** evidence for “far transfer” from cognitive training in general is mixed. This app is designed to *increase the probability* of real-world carryover by combining **guided testing**, **portability checks across contexts**, and **implementation intentions** (cue-based plans), rather than relying on insight or motivation alone.

---

## What this app trains 

You practise **mindware tools** in lots of different scenarios, so you can:
- spot the **best next step** (not the tempting one),
- choose actions under **trade-offs** and **uncertainty**,
- tighten claims and avoid reasoning traps,
- simplify complexity under constraints,
- and convert the learning into a **repeatable mission habit**.

## How skills become automatic (Trident-G: effort → habit)

In Trident-G, you do not just “learn an idea”. You **build a skill that becomes easy to use**.

This happens in three stages:

1) **Effort mode (Gf)**  
   You use a mindware tool deliberately, step by step. It takes attention.

2) **Compilation (Gc)**  
   If a tool works, you **compress it into a Mindware Card** (a short script you can recall quickly).  
   This “compiling” step is a *deliberate part of training*, not an afterthought.

3) **Reuse under pressure (back to Gf when needed)**  
   You then use the card in different situations. Over time it becomes fast and reliable, even when you are busy or stressed.

**Key point:** making a tool “automatic” takes strategic effort.  
This app supports that by combining **timed practice**, **real missions**, and **saving/reusing Mindware Cards**.

---
## The four mission types (how scenarios are organised)

Scenarios and missions come in four categories:

1) **Understand** (make sense of something)
2) **Discuss** (handle disagreement or arguments)
3) **Choose** (decide under trade-offs)
4) **Plan & Do** (move a plan forward)

These categories are also how the app checks whether a tool “travels” across different kinds of problem.

---

## The nine mindware tools (v1)

Each session focuses on **one** tool.

1) **The One Test**  
   When you’re stuck: “What quick check would change what I do next?”

2) **Trade-Off Choice**  
   When options compete: “What matters most, and what could flip the best option?”

3) **Expected Value Choice**  
   When outcomes are uncertain: “Value × probability, then compare.”

4) **Claim → Support**  
   When debating: “What’s the claim, what supports it, and does it truly support it?”

5) **Evidence Update**  
   When new evidence arrives: “Update confidence based on strength and relevance.”

6) **Cause Chain**  
   When deciding what will work: “Driver → mechanism → outcome. What would I expect to see?”

7) **Bottleneck First**  
   When busy but not moving: “What constraint is actually limiting progress?”

8) **Make It Measurable**  
   When goals are vague: “What would I actually observe if I’m improving?”

9) **Simplify Under Constraints**  
   When it feels messy: “What’s the smallest useful picture that still lets me act?”

## Three ways to use this app

### 1) Standalone (simple)
Use Mindware Coach as your daily or weekly mindware practice:
**Practice (timed) → Mission → Save card.**

### 2) After **Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended)
Run **Ψ Zone Coach first** (separately), then do Mindware training.
This keeps mindware sessions aligned with your current state.

> This app does **not** do zone recalibration. All state regulation and recovery steps live in **Ψ Zone Coach**.

### 3) Full stack (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission)
If you use the integrated Trident-G protocol:

1. **Ψ Zone Coach**: check state and choose session intensity  
2. **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: short drill block (optional warm-up or main training)  
3. **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed scenarios + feedback + mission planning  
4. **Mission**: apply the tool in real life (10–20 mins)

A future **G Loop app** will coordinate this full flow for users who want the complete protocol.

## What a session looks like (simple)

### Step 1 — Choose today’s mission type + mindware tool (30 seconds)
- Pick **Understand / Discuss / Choose / Plan & Do**
- Pick **one** mindware tool (the app can recommend one)

### Step 2 — Timed practice with feedback (3–8 minutes)
You’ll do a short scenario set with:
- **multiple choice** questions,
- **time limits** (optional),
- and **instant feedback** (right/wrong + a short explanation).

### Step 3 — Choose a real-life mission (10–20 minutes)
You specify something real you need to do today.

### Step 4 — Use it in a real mission (10–20 minutes)
You apply the tool to something real you need to do today.

**Examples**
- **Understand:** “Read a project brief and write a 5-sentence summary plus 3 ‘check questions’.”
- **Discuss:** “Draft a calm reply to a disagreement: one clear claim, two supports, one counterpoint, then revise once.”
- **Choose:** “Pick between two options using Trade-Off Choice or Expected Value, then do one quick ‘flip check’ (what would change your mind?).”
- **Plan & Do:** “Write the next 3 steps for a task and do step 1 immediately.”

### Step 5 — Compile it into a Mindware Card (30–60 seconds)
If it helped, you convert it into a short recall script:  
**Trigger → Steps → Quick check → Common trap.**

This is the “compiling” step that turns effortful thinking into a reusable habit.

**Example Mindware Card (The One Test)**
- **Trigger:** “When I feel stuck or I’m about to do ‘more research’ again.”
- **Steps:**  
  1) Name the main uncertainty  
  2) List 2 possible answers  
  3) Pick one quick check that would separate them  
  4) Decide what I’ll do if the check goes either way
- **Quick check:** “I can write the test in one sentence and it would genuinely change my next step.”
- **Common trap:** “Wandering into more reading with no specific test.”

**Example Mindware Card (Expected Value Choice)**
- **Trigger:** “When outcomes are uncertain and I’m choosing between options.”
- **Steps:**  
  1) List the options  
  2) For each, estimate probability and value  
  3) Compute ‘probability × value’ (rough is fine)  
  4) Do a flip check: ‘what probability/value would change the winner?’
- **Quick check:** “I can say what would flip the decision.”
- **Common trap:** “Choosing by emotion or story while pretending I’m doing the maths.”

**Example Mindware Card (Simplify Under Constraints)**
- **Trigger:** “When the problem feels too big and I’m overwhelmed.”
- **Steps:**  
  1) List up to 6 factors  
  2) Circle the top 3 that truly matter  
  3) Name the hard constraint (time/energy/money)  
  4) Choose one smallest action or check that fits
- **Quick check:** “I have one clear next step that fits the constraint.”
- **Common trap:** “Trying to model everything and doing nothing.”

### Step 6 — Reuse it later (portability checks)
The app will bring the same tool back in a different kind of scenario, and prompt you to use your card again in daily life.

**Examples**
- You practise **The One Test** today in a **Choose** scenario (decision).  
  Later, the app gives you **The One Test** in a **Discuss** scenario (argument), to see if you can still pick the best settling question.
- You practise **Evidence Update** today in an **Understand** scenario (reading).  
  Later, the app gives you **Evidence Update** in a **Plan & Do** scenario (project planning), to see if you update your confidence when a new constraint appears.
- You practise **Bottleneck First** today in a **Plan & Do** scenario (workflow).  
  Later, the app gives you **Bottleneck First** in an **Understand** scenario (learning), to see if you can spot the limiting missing concept rather than studying everything.

**Daily-life reuse prompt examples**
- “When you open your inbox today, run your **One Test** card for 2 minutes before taking action.”
- “Before you decide, run your **Trade-Off / Expected Value** card and do one flip check.”
- “When you feel overwhelmed, run your **Simplify Under Constraints** card and choose one smallest next step.”

## The practice engine (how you get right/wrong feedback)

Each tool has many scenarios across all four mission types, so practice stays varied and measurable.

Typical question formats:
- **Single best answer** (A–D)
- **Spot the trap** (the tempting wrong option)
- **Order the steps** (3-step sequencing)
- **Pick the best check/metric** (what would actually test it?)
- **Simplify choice** (best “minimum useful” version)

Each question includes:
- the correct answer,
- a one-line “why this is right”,
- and a short reason the main traps fail.

---

## Portability checks (how this app tests “does it travel?”)

This app runs **portability swaps** by keeping the same mindware tool but changing the scenario type:

- **Understand ↔ Discuss ↔ Choose ↔ Plan & Do**

Example:
- You practise **The One Test** in a “Choose” scenario today,
- then the app gives you **The One Test** in a “Discuss” scenario later.

To the user it feels like variety.
To the system it is a carryover check.

---

## Missions (real-world deployment)

A mission is a small, repeatable, measurable task you genuinely need to do.
It is not extra homework. It is the “carryover step”.

Examples:
- **Understand**: 5-sentence summary + 3 questions you can answer without re-reading
- **Discuss**: write a narrower claim + the strongest support + one counterpoint
- **Choose**: quick trade-off grid + a simple “what would flip this?” check
- **Plan & Do**: next 3 steps + do step 1 immediately

---

## Mindware Operators (what you build over time)

Each session can save an operator with:

- **Trigger** (When should I use this?)
- **Steps** (3–5 bullets)
- **Common trap** (what to avoid)
- **Quick check** (how to know it worked)

Simple progress labels:

Simple progress labels:
- **Practised** (I can do it with effort)
- **Compiled** (I have a clear card I can follow)
- **Used in real life** (it works on a mission)
- **Works in different situations** (it travels)
- **Reliable habit** (it’s fast and dependable)

This is how Trident-G turns effortful skill into reliable habit. 
---

## Optional warm-up (if you also use Capacity Coach)

If you use **IQ Capacity Training Coach**, a short warm-up can make mindware practice easier under time pressure:

- Feeling distracted or mentally noisy → **Standard n-back**
- Need to understand cause/effect links → **Transitive**
- Need to plan steps or choose a route → **Graph**
- Need to argue clearly or test a claim → **Propositional**

Warm-ups are optional. The core learning in this app is:
**timed practice → feedback → mission → repeat.**

---

## What this app stores (privacy)

IQ Mindware Coach stores your progress **locally in your own browser** (via `localStorage`) so it can work without accounts.

Stored items include:
- practice scores (right/wrong, time taken),
- chosen tools and mission types,
- saved Mindware Cards,
- mission plans (implementation intentions),
- basic streak/usage history.

*No cloud upload by default.*  
If you clear your browser storage, your local history resets.

---

## Troubleshooting

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

---

## Where this fits in the wider Trident-G stack

- **Ψ Zone Coach**: state check + recovery steps (separate app)
- **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: n-back drills (control + relational structure learning)
- **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed mindware training + missions (this app). Mindware Coach is where Trident-G’s **effort → compile → reuse** loop is built, using Mindware Cards as the “compiled” form.
- **G Loop app (future)**: an optional “hub” that coordinates the full protocol across the three apps
