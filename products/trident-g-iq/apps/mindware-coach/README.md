# IQ Mindware Coach (Trident-G)

IQ Mindware Coach is a **short, structured mindware training app** that helps you practise practical thinking tools with **timed, right/wrong feedback**, then apply them to a **real-life mission** so they become habits you can reuse.

It is designed to work:
- **Standalone** (mindware practice + missions),
- **Alongside Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended as a separate first step), and
- **As part of the full Trident-G stack** (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission).

> **Important note:** evidence for “far transfer” from cognitive training in general is mixed. This app is designed to *increase the probability* of real-world carryover by combining **guided testing**, **portability checks across contexts**, and **implementation intentions** (cue-based plans), rather than relying on insight or motivation alone.

---

## What this app trains (in plain English)

You practise **mindware tools** in lots of different scenarios, so you can:
- spot the **best next step** (not the tempting one),
- choose actions under **trade-offs** and **uncertainty**,
- tighten claims and avoid reasoning traps,
- simplify complexity under constraints,
- and convert the learning into a **repeatable mission habit**.

---

## The four mission types (how scenarios are organised)

Scenarios and missions come in four categories:

1) **Understand** (make sense of something)
2) **Discuss** (handle disagreement or arguments)
3) **Choose** (decide under trade-offs)
4) **Plan & Do** (move a plan forward)

These categories are also how the app checks whether a tool “travels” across different kinds of problem.

---

## The nine mindware tools (v1)

Each session focuses on **one** tool.

1) **The One Test**  
   When you’re stuck: “What quick check would change what I do next?”

2) **Trade-Off Choice**  
   When options compete: “What matters most, and what could flip the best option?”

3) **Expected Value Choice**  
   When outcomes are uncertain: “Value × probability, then compare.”

4) **Claim → Support**  
   When debating: “What’s the claim, what supports it, and does it truly support it?”

5) **Evidence Update**  
   When new evidence arrives: “Update confidence based on strength and relevance.”

6) **Cause Chain**  
   When deciding what will work: “Driver → mechanism → outcome. What would I expect to see?”

7) **Bottleneck First**  
   When busy but not moving: “What constraint is actually limiting progress?”

8) **Make It Measurable**  
   When goals are vague: “What would I actually observe if I’m improving?”

9) **Simplify Under Constraints**  
   When it feels messy: “What’s the smallest useful picture that still lets me act?”

## Three ways to use this app

### 1) Standalone (simple)
Use Mindware Coach as your daily or weekly mindware practice:
**Practice (timed) → Mission → Save card.**

### 2) After **Ψ Zone Coach** (recommended)
Run **Ψ Zone Coach first** (separately), then do Mindware training.
This keeps mindware sessions aligned with your current state.

> This app does **not** do zone recalibration. All state regulation and recovery steps live in **Ψ Zone Coach**.

### 3) Full stack (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission)
If you use the integrated Trident-G protocol:

1. **Ψ Zone Coach**: check state and choose session intensity  
2. **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: short drill block (optional warm-up or main training)  
3. **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed scenarios + feedback + mission planning  
4. **Mission**: apply the tool in real life (10–20 mins)

A future **G Loop app** will coordinate this full flow for users who want the complete protocol.

---

## What a session looks like (simple)

### Step 1 — Choose today’s mission type + mindware tool (30 seconds)
- Pick **Understand / Discuss / Choose / Plan & Do**
- Pick **one** mindware tool (the app can recommend one)

### Step 2 — Timed practice with feedback (3–8 minutes)
You’ll do a short scenario set with:
- **multiple choice** questions,
- **time limits** (optional),
- and **instant feedback** (right/wrong + a short explanation).

### Step 3 — Choose a real-life mission (10–20 minutes)
You specify something real you need to do today.

### Step 4 — Set an implementation intention (cue-based plan)
A short “When X, I will Y” plan so the tool actually fires in daily life.

Example:
> “When I open the email thread, I will write the **one test** that would change my next step for 2 minutes, then decide what to do.”

### Step 5 — Save a Mindware Card
The app compiles your session into a reusable card you can redeploy.

## The practice engine (how you get right/wrong feedback)

Each tool has many scenarios across all four mission types, so practice stays varied and measurable.

Typical question formats:
- **Single best answer** (A–D)
- **Spot the trap** (the tempting wrong option)
- **Order the steps** (3-step sequencing)
- **Pick the best check/metric** (what would actually test it?)
- **Simplify choice** (best “minimum useful” version)

Each question includes:
- the correct answer,
- a one-line “why this is right”,
- and a short reason the main traps fail.

---

## Portability checks (how this app tests “does it travel?”)

This app runs **portability swaps** by keeping the same mindware tool but changing the scenario type:

- **Understand ↔ Discuss ↔ Choose ↔ Plan & Do**

Example:
- You practise **The One Test** in a “Choose” scenario today,
- then the app gives you **The One Test** in a “Discuss” scenario later.

To the user it feels like variety.
To the system it is a carryover check.

---

## Missions (real-world deployment)

A mission is a small, repeatable, measurable task you genuinely need to do.
It is not extra homework. It is the “carryover step”.

Examples:
- **Understand**: 5-sentence summary + 3 questions you can answer without re-reading
- **Discuss**: write a narrower claim + the strongest support + one counterpoint
- **Choose**: quick trade-off grid + a simple “what would flip this?” check
- **Plan & Do**: next 3 steps + do step 1 immediately

---

## Mindware Cards (what you build over time)

Each session can save a card with:

- **Trigger** (When should I use this?)
- **Steps** (3–5 bullets)
- **Common trap** (what to avoid)
- **Quick check** (how to know it worked)

Simple progress labels:
- **Saved** → **Tried once** → **Works in different situations** → **Reliable habit**

---

## Optional warm-up (if you also use Capacity Coach)

If you use **IQ Capacity Training Coach**, a short warm-up can make mindware practice easier under time pressure:

- Feeling distracted or mentally noisy → **Standard n-back**
- Need to understand cause/effect links → **Transitive**
- Need to plan steps or choose a route → **Graph**
- Need to argue clearly or test a claim → **Propositional**

Warm-ups are optional. The core learning in this app is:
**timed practice → feedback → mission → repeat.**

---

## What this app stores (privacy)

IQ Mindware Coach stores your progress **locally in your own browser** (via `localStorage`) so it can work without accounts.

Stored items include:
- practice scores (right/wrong, time taken),
- chosen tools and mission types,
- saved Mindware Cards,
- mission plans (implementation intentions),
- basic streak/usage history.

*No cloud upload by default.*  
If you clear your browser storage, your local history resets.

---

## Troubleshooting

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

---

## Where this fits in the wider Trident-G stack

- **Ψ Zone Coach**: state check + recovery steps (separate app)
- **IQ Capacity Training Coach**: n-back drills (control + relational structure learning)
- **IQ Mindware Coach**: timed mindware training + missions (this app)
- **G Loop app (future)**: an optional “hub” that coordinates the full protocol across the three apps
