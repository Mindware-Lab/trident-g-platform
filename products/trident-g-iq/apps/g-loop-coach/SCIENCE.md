#  g Loop Coach (Trident-G): Scientific basis for a far-transfer architecture

> **Purpose.** This document summarises the research basis for **g Loop Coach**, the session-level “glue” that coordinates **state → focus → action → learning → reuse** in the Trident-G stack, and explains why the architecture is designed to **increase the probability** of real-world carryover (far transfer) despite the mixed evidence base for cognitive training in general.

> **Important note.** Far transfer from cognitive training is **not guaranteed**, and broad “IQ gains” claims are controversial. Many studies show **near transfer** with limited or inconsistent **far transfer**, and placebo/expectancy effects can be large. The g-Loop architecture is designed specifically to address these known failure modes by adding **state-gating**, **testing/feedback**, **explicit portability probes**, and **cue-based reuse** (mindware scripts), rather than assuming that practice alone will generalise.

## 1) What “far transfer” means here

### 1.1 Transfer is not one thing
The transfer literature distinguishes:
- **Near transfer**: improvement to tasks highly similar to what was trained.
- **Far transfer**: improvement that **travels** to tasks with different surface features, where only deeper structure overlaps.

Classic work emphasises that far transfer depends on **what is actually learned**, **how it is indexed for retrieval**, and **whether the new context cues the right knowledge/strategy** (Perkins & Salomon, 1992; Barnett & Ceci, 2002; Bransford & Schwartz, 1999).

### 1.2 Trident-G operational definition
In Trident-G, “far transfer” is treated as a **behaviourally testable property**:

> A skill/strategy counts as transferred if it can be **re-deployed** under **different wrappers** (mission types) with minimal degradation, including after delay.

So transfer is not assumed. It is *probed* using:
- **Portability swaps** (across mission types: Understand ↔ Discuss ↔ Choose ↔ Plan & Do)
- **Delayed reuse checks**
- **Surface variation** while preserving a target **relational invariant** (“what must generalise?”)

This approach aligns with transfer theory emphasising **relational structure** and retrieval cues, rather than surface similarity (Gentner, 1983; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Barnett & Ceci, 2002).

---

## 2) Why far transfer often fails (and what g-Loop is designed to fix)

### 2.1 The “thin automation” problem (wrapper-bound learning)
A common failure mode in brain training is becoming efficient at **task-specific routines** that do not generalise (Shipstead et al., 2012; Simons et al., 2016; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). Even when performance rises steeply, the *learned operator* may be tightly coupled to the task’s **UI cues**, stimulus format, or scoring contingencies.

**g-Loop response:** separate:
- **(a) the wrapper** (where you use a method: Understand/Discuss/Choose/Plan), from
- **(b) the carryover target** (what must generalise), and
- **(c) the portable operator/script** (how you reliably act).

### 2.2 Mixed evidence and expectancy effects
Meta-analyses and consensus reviews report that:
- working memory/cognitive training often yields **near transfer**, but far transfer is inconsistent or small (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Sala & Gobet, 2019; Simons et al., 2016),
- and expectancy/placebo effects can inflate apparent gains (Foroughi et al., 2016).

**g-Loop response:** treat transfer as a **measurement problem**:
- require **observable outputs** (a concrete test/action),
- run **portability probes** across contexts,
- and encourage **delayed checks**, which reduce “short-term glow” effects.

### 2.3 “Knowing” a strategy is not the same as using it under load
Even validated strategies fail if:
- the context does not cue retrieval,
- time pressure triggers default habits,
- or the person is in a dysregulated state (stress, fatigue, high distraction).

**g-Loop response:** state-gate + timebox + cue-based scripts:
- **State-gating** reduces the chance that the session is run in an untrainable state.
- **Rigour budgets (timeboxing)** prevent rumination or panic-grinding.
- **Mindware scripts** explicitly bind a method to a trigger and a quick check (implementation-intention logic).

---

## 3) The g-Loop architecture (session control logic)

### 3.1 Core loop (simplified)
A g-Loop session is organised as:

1. **Choose loop horizon** (quick/day/week)
2. **Define “smallest win”** + success signal  
3. **State gate** (preferably via Ψ Zone Coach; otherwise a brief self-check)
4. **Rigour budget** (light/normal/deep timebox)
5. **Choose wrapper** (Understand / Discuss / Choose / Plan & Do)
6. **Run one discriminating test or action**
7. **Capture what changed**
8. **Compile into a mindware script**
9. **Schedule a reuse check** in a different context and/or after delay

### 3.2 Why these steps map to evidence

#### (A) “One discriminating test/action” is retrieval + feedback, not passive reflection
A large educational psychology literature shows that **practice testing** (retrieval with feedback) improves durable learning and often improves transfer more than rereading or restudying (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006; Butler, 2010; Karpicke & Blunt, 2011).

**g-Loop implication:** the session must produce an output that changes beliefs or moves the plan:
- a mini-decision artefact,
- a short argument revision,
- a concrete first step completed,
- or a sharply defined “what would change my mind?” test.

This is aligned with “desirable difficulties” principles: effort that strengthens later retrieval and application (Dunlosky et al., 2013).

#### (B) Minimal mapping targets relational structure (a key driver of transfer)
Transfer depends strongly on extracting **deep relational structure** and mapping it to a new case (Gentner, 1983; Gick & Holyoak, 1983). Expert–novice work shows novices over-weight surface features, while expertise involves representing problems by underlying principles (Chi et al., 1981).

**g-Loop implication:** “minimal map” should capture relations such as:
- claim → evidence → warrant,
- cause → effect,
- constraint → trade-off,
- goal → subgoal → operator,
not merely a list of facts.

#### (C) “Portability swaps” operationalise transfer instead of assuming it
Barnett & Ceci (2002) argue that transfer must be characterised across multiple dimensions (knowledge domain, physical context, time, function). Bransford & Schwartz (1999) emphasise preparation for future learning, not just replication.

**g-Loop implication:** portability is probed by:
- changing mission wrapper (e.g., from “Choose” to “Discuss”),
- changing surface features while preserving the relational target,
- and repeating after a delay.

#### (D) “Compile into a mindware script” is about cueing and automaticity
Even good methods fail if they are not retrieved in the moment. Implementation-intention research shows that **if-then plans** reliably increase execution by linking a cue to a response (Gollwitzer, 1999). Habit formation research suggests repetition under stable cues gradually increases automaticity (Lally et al., 2010).

**g-Loop implication:** scripts are stored as:
- **Trigger → Steps → Quick check → Common trap**
so the method becomes easier to deploy under load.

#### (E) Timeboxing is a bounded rationality control
Under uncertainty and finite time, “perfect” optimisation is often impossible. Bounded rationality emphasises satisficing and resource-aware strategy selection (Simon, 1956).

**g-Loop implication:** rigour budgets prevent:
- endless research spirals,
- affect-driven overthinking,
- and effort without decision closure.

## 4) Where this sits relative to “brain training” evidence

### 4.1 Working memory and n-back: useful, but not sufficient
The literature on working memory training and n-back shows:
- some studies report improvements on certain Gf measures (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2008; Au et al., 2015),
- but many well-controlled studies and meta-analyses find limited evidence for broad far transfer (Redick et al., 2013; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Sala & Gobet, 2019),
- and expectancy/placebo effects can be substantial (Foroughi et al., 2016).

**Trident-G stance:** capacity training may be valuable for:
- attentional stability,
- interference control,
- task discipline under load,
but far transfer is more likely when paired with:
- explicit portable strategies,
- real missions,
- and portability probes.

### 4.2 The g-Loop is an anti-“near transfer only” layer
Rather than treating cognitive training as a single mechanism, Trident-G treats far transfer as requiring **multiple aligned constraints**:
1) a trainable state,
2) a portable target,
3) a discriminating test/action,
4) compilation into a cue-linked script,
5) proof of travel across contexts and time.

---

## 5) Trident-G theory: the Gf → Gc → Gf transfer cycle (Life on the Cusp)

### 5.1 The basic transfer hypothesis
In **Life on the Cusp**, Trident-G frames general intelligence as a **general adaptive capacity** supported by controlled switching between modes and by “compiling” useful problem-solving into reusable knowledge/skills (Ashton Smith, 2025).

In g-Loop terms:
- **Gf (fluid)**: create or select operators under novelty and uncertainty.
- **Gc (crystallised)**: compress what worked into a stable, retrievable script.
- **Return to Gf**: re-deploy the script in a new context and adapt it.

This is why the architecture forces:
- **capture** (what worked),
- **compilation** (script),
- **reuse** (portability check).

### 5.2 Why “mindware scripts” matter mechanistically
A mindware script is a compact representation that:
- reduces working memory load,
- increases retrieval probability under stress,
- and standardises a decision/argument/planning routine.

This aligns with broad skill acquisition ideas in cognitive psychology where repeated successful procedures become faster and more automatic, freeing resources for higher-level control (general principle consistent with automaticity/skill acquisition accounts).

---

## 6) Zhang & Tang (entropy–mutual information) account and how g-Loop uses it

### 6.1 The core idea (high level)
Zhang & Tang (2025) show that **heavy-tailed update distributions** can arise in learning systems when updates follow a **maximum entropy** principle while being constrained by **mutual information** with task objectives. Intuitively, this kind of framework helps explain why learning often shows:
- long plateaus,
- punctuated “clicks” or restructurings,
- and a mixture of many small refinements plus occasional large jumps.

### 6.2 Trident-G mapping
Trident-G uses an analogous control intuition:

- **Entropy (exploration pressure):** when the current approach stops paying off, you need broader search over representations/operators.
- **Mutual information (tether):** search must stay tied to what matters, or you get noise and “interesting but irrelevant” wandering.

In Trident-G notation, the **τ-tether** can be read as the mechanism that keeps exploration anchored to the portable target (“what must carry over?”), rather than to wrapper cues.

### 6.3 How g-Loop instantiates this in a buildable way
g-Loop makes the entropy–MI balance concrete via three design constraints:

1) **Rigour budget (timebox):** prevents runaway exploration.
2) **Carryover target (Y-tether):** specifies the invariant your method must preserve.
3) **Discriminating test:** forces exploration to cash out into information gain and action.

This is the practical interpretation of an entropy–MI trade-off:
- widen search when stuck,
- but force the next step to be *informative* and *portable*.

---

## 7) State gating and “Ψ-band” rationale (why state is not optional)

### 7.1 Why state matters for reasoning and transfer
Cognitive control is strongly modulated by arousal, stress, and fatigue. Models of self-regulation and stress physiology emphasise that chronic or acute dysregulation degrades executive control and increases default/habitual responding.

### 7.2 HRV and neurovisceral integration (supporting evidence)
Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely used as a non-invasive index related to autonomic regulation and flexible adaptation, with guidelines for measurement and reporting (Laborde et al., 2017; Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017). The neurovisceral integration framework links regulatory capacity across brain–body systems to emotion and cognition (Thayer & Lane, 2009).

### 7.3 Explore/exploit and arousal control
The LC-NE adaptive gain theory links tonic/phasic arousal dynamics to shifts between exploitation and exploration (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005). This provides a mechanistic rationale for:
- reducing loop size when dysregulated,
- choosing simpler tasks when out of zone,
- and using recovery protocols before demanding reasoning.

**Design takeaway:** g-Loop treats “state” as a gate because transfer is less likely when the session is run in a state that pushes you into brittle habits.

---

## 8) What g-Loop predicts (falsifiable expectations)

If the architecture is working as intended, you should see:
1) **Higher completion of concrete outputs** (tests/actions) per session.
2) **Higher reuse rates** of scripts (measured by scheduled reuse checks actually done).
3) **Better cross-wrapper portability**: scripts continue to function when the mission type changes.
4) **Less wrapper-specific overfitting**: performance improvements are not confined to one format.
5) **More stable performance under load** when sessions are state-gated.

These are measurable within the app logs without claiming IQ change.

---

## 9) Limitations and responsible claims

- g-Loop is an evidence-informed architecture, not a guarantee of far transfer.
- Cognitive training studies often show limited far transfer, and expectancy effects can be large (Simons et al., 2016; Foroughi et al., 2016).
- Claims should focus on **observable behavioural outputs** and **portability measures** (reuse across contexts/time), not on global intelligence claims without controlled evaluation.
