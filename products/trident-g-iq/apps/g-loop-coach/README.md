# g Loop Coach (Trident-G)

g Loop Coach is the **overarching session app** for Trident-G. It helps you run a complete “loop” from **state → focus → action → learning → reuse**, with optional integration into:

- **Ψ Zone Coach** (state check + recovery)
- **IQ Capacity Training Coach** (n-back drills)
- **IQ Mindware Coach** (timed mindware practice + missions + mindware scripts)

You can use g Loop Coach **standalone**, but it works best as the coordinator for the full Trident-G stack.

> **Important note:** evidence for “far transfer” from cognitive training in general is mixed. This stack is designed to *increase the probability* of real-world carryover by adding state-gating, timeboxing, explicit missions, portability checks across contexts, and “compile + reuse” (mindware scripts), rather than relying on insight or motivation alone.

## What g Loop Coach does  

In one place, it helps you:

1) **Get clear on the mission**
2) **Pick the smallest win** that counts today
3) **Choose how much rigour is worth it** (timebox)
4) **Do one concrete test or action**
5) **Capture what worked**
6) **Turn it into a reusable mindware script**
7) **Re-use it later in a different context** (carryover check)

---

## How it integrates the other apps (optional)

g Loop Coach can launch the other apps at the right moments:

1) **Ψ Zone Coach**  
   Run first (recommended). g Loop Coach uses it as the state gate.

2) **IQ Capacity Training Coach**  
   Optional drill block (short warm-up or main training). Good when you need sharper focus or cleaner control under pressure.

3) **IQ Mindware Coach**  
   Timed scenario practice (right/wrong feedback) + mission planning + **mindware script** compilation.

A future “hub” is not needed: **g Loop Coach is the hub** for the protocol. The other apps remain usable on their own.

## What a session looks like (simple version)

### Step 1 — Pick your loop size (10 seconds)
Choose the time horizon for today’s loop:
- **Quick loop** (10–20 minutes)
- **Day loop** (today)
- **Week loop** (this week)

### Step 2 — Define the smallest win (20 seconds)
Answer:
- “What would count as a win by the end of this loop?”
- “How will I notice it?” (a simple success signal)

### Step 3 — State gate (recommended via Ψ Zone Coach)
- If you’ve run **Ψ Zone Coach**, g Loop Coach will use that result.
- If you haven’t, g Loop Coach can still continue with a **quick self-check**, but it will recommend running Zone Coach next time.

**Safety rule:** if you are not in a workable state, reduce the scope (smaller win, shorter timebox) or stop and restart later.

### Step 4 — Set a rigour budget (timebox) (10 seconds)
Choose:
- **Light** (3–5 min thinking)
- **Normal** (5–10 min thinking)
- **Deep** (10–20 min thinking)

This stops overthinking, panic-grinding, or “wandering research”.

### Step 5 — Choose the mission type (the “lens”) (10 seconds)
Pick the wrapper for today’s mission:
- **Understand** (make sense of something)
- **Discuss** (handle disagreement)
- **Choose** (decide under trade-offs)
- **Plan & Do** (move a plan forward)

### Step 6 — Do one smallest test or action (3–15 minutes)
You must do **one concrete step** that either:
- creates value now, or
- reduces uncertainty enough to change the plan.

Examples:
- **Understand:** write a 5-sentence summary + 3 questions you can answer without re-reading
- **Discuss:** write a narrower claim + strongest support + one counterpoint, then revise once
- **Choose:** do a trade-off grid or expected value estimate, then a “what would flip this?” check
- **Plan & Do:** write the next 3 steps and do step 1 immediately

### Step 7 — Capture what changed (30 seconds)
Quick check:
- Did I move closer to the win?
- What did I learn?
- What was the main trap or near-miss?

### Step 8 — Compile it into a **mindware script** (30–60 seconds)
If it helped, compress it into a fast recall script:

**Trigger → Steps → Quick check → Common trap**

This is the Trident-G “effort → habit” mechanism: deliberate thinking becomes a reusable script.

### Step 9 — Schedule a reuse check (10 seconds)
g Loop Coach prompts you to reuse the same mindware script later:
- in a **different mission type**, and/or
- in a real-life moment that matches your trigger.

That’s how carryover is tested, not assumed.

---

## Two kinds of swaps (to keep the system clear)

This stack uses two different kinds of “swap”:

### 1) Capacity Coach swaps = **game swaps**
These happen inside n-back training:
- colour ↔ letter ↔ location  
- transitive ↔ graph ↔ propositional

Goal: controlled variation inside training.

### 2) g Loop / Mindware swaps = **portability swaps**
These happen across real-world mission types:
- Understand ↔ Discuss ↔ Choose ↔ Plan & Do

Goal: proof that a mindware script works across different contexts, not just one format.

---

## Trident-G “effort → habit” (why mindware scripts matter)

In Trident-G, you start in **effort mode**: the method takes attention.

If it works, you **compile** it into a **mindware script** so it becomes:
- easier to retrieve,
- faster to run,
- more reliable under pressure.

Carryover is strengthened when the script is:
- used on real missions,
- reused on different mission types,
- and still works a few days later.

## Using g Loop Coach in three ways

### 1) Standalone (simple)
Run the loop using your own tasks and missions.
You can still save mindware scripts and schedule reuse checks.

### 2) Zone + g Loop (recommended)
Run **Ψ Zone Coach** first, then use g Loop Coach to select the mission and keep the loop clean and timeboxed.

### 3) Full Trident-G session (Zone → Capacity → Mindware → Mission)
Use g Loop Coach to coordinate:
- state gate (Zone)
- optional drill (Capacity)
- timed practice + mission planning + mindware script (Mindware)
- real mission and later reuse checks (g Loop Coach reminders)

---

## What this app stores (privacy)

g Loop Coach stores session records **locally in your own browser** (via `localStorage`) so it can work without accounts.

Stored items include:
- loop size, smallest win, success signal
- timebox choice
- mission type
- what test/action you ran
- outcome notes
- saved mindware scripts
- scheduled reuse checks

*No cloud upload by default.*  
If you clear your browser storage, your local history resets.

## Troubleshooting

**GitHub Pages shows an old version**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) / `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- It can take a minute or two for Pages to serve the newest build.

## Appendix: the 12-step Trident-G loop (for transparency)

The app uses a simplified front end, but the engine follows these steps:

1) Choose loop size + smallest win  
2) State gate (recommended via Ψ Zone Coach)  
3) Rigour budget (timebox) + anti-grind guardrails  
4) One-line problem statement (what to win)  
5) Minimal map (what matters and how it connects)  
6) “What must carry over?” (your carryover target)  
7) Quick environment check (what you can adjust today vs log for later)  
8) Choose stance: explore briefly or execute cleanly  
9) Smallest discriminating test (one step that changes the plan)  
10) Decide: tune the current approach or change approach  
11) Capture the insight quickly (candidate learning)  
12) Prove it travels: reuse in a new context + real mission + delayed re-check

You do not need to memorise this. g Loop Coach walks you through a simple version.
